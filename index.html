        What idea it had been that had sent me so audaciously trespassing I could
        not now remember. The spirit of peace descended like a cloud from heaven,
        for the spirit of peace dwells anywhere; it is in the courts and
        quadrangles of Oxbridge on a fine October morning. It is in the long
        corridors and the small thresholds, in the hush of a studio late at night,
        in the patient act of looking, and in the work of arranging form so it can
        hold a life. Some mornings it arrives quietly—through light on a wall,
        through the measured distance between objects, through a room that feels
        carefully made.

            Mercedes Ramirez is an architectural designer based in Los Angeles,
            working across architecture, objects, and image-making with a focus on
            quiet composition and material clarity. She received her Bachelor of
            Architecture from Cal Poly Pomona, where her work emphasized careful
            spatial sequencing, atmosphere, and the relationship between everyday
            rituals and the built environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her professional experience includes work with Lanza Atelier in Mexico
            City and HSU McCullough in Los Angeles. Across these contexts, she has
            contributed to projects from early concept development through
            drawing-based refinement—valuing precision, restraint, and the
            discipline of making ideas legible through plan, section, and detail.
            This portfolio gathers selected studies and projects that explore
            proportion, light, and the subtle weight of objects in space.

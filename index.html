            Mercedes Ramirez is an architectural designer based in Los Angeles,
            working across architecture, objects, and image-making with a focus on
            quiet composition and material clarity. She received her Bachelor of
            Architecture from Cal Poly Pomona, where her work emphasized careful
            spatial sequencing, atmosphere, and the relationship between everyday
            rituals and the built environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her professional experience includes work with Lanza Atelier in Mexico
            City and HSU McCullough in Los Angeles. Across these contexts, she has
            contributed to projects from early concept development through
            drawing-based refinement—valuing precision, restraint, and the
            discipline of making ideas legible through plan, section, and detail.
            This portfolio gathers selected studies and projects that explore
            proportion, light, and the subtle weight of objects in space.
          </p>

          <!-- NEW PARAGRAPH -->
          <p>
            Outside of practice, Mercedes finds balance in time with family,
            baking, and long walks with her dogs—rituals that shape her
            sensitivity to the emotional weight of space. She is committed to
            people-centered architecture that is community-driven, culturally
            aware, and socially responsive, approaching design through empathy,
            collaboration, and careful listening. Her goal is to contribute to
            work that meets practical needs while fostering identity, belonging,
            and lasting connection to place.

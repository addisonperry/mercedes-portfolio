            The Hollyhock House stands as a compact, horizontal structure, 
            embodying a courtyard typology that harmonizes architecture with 
            nature. Drawing from this, my design proposes a live-study addition 
            that enhances spatial flexibility and reduces material complexity, 
            while respecting the house’s original horizontal layout.
          </p>

          <p>
            This addition serves as a collaborative space for students, 
            incorporating exhibition areas to showcase their work in dialogue 
            with the historic structure. A linear circulation path links these 
            spaces, and the use of materials—uniform yet varied in porosity—
            creates a dynamic visual rhythm that ensures privacy while connecting 
            visually to the original house.
          </p>

          <p>
            The project centers around two key systems: a robust steel framework
            and adaptable wood panels. Together, they establish a design language 
            that respects the Hollyhock House’s horizontal emphasis while exploring 
            new spatial configurations. Honoring Aline Barnsdall’s vision, the 
            design offers residents the freedom to personalize their environment 
            through the interplay of steel and wood, modulated by glass. This 
            allows for a customizable balance of opacity, transparency, and 
            translucency, empowering individuals to shape spaces that reflect 
            their unique experiences within this historic setting.

          A Kitchen for Community
        </h1>

        <div class="project-body">
          <p>
            This project, located near Leimert Park along Crenshaw Blvd, extends the
            intimate act of gathering into the urban fabric by combining affordable
            housing with a communal kitchen. The family kitchen becomes a shared
            community space—a nucleus for exchange that transcends place,
            generations, and cultures. Just as my family kitchen fostered
            togetherness, this project explores cooking and creation as a social
            and collaborative ritual.
          </p>

          <p>
            By diagramming the kitchen at an urban scale, the project transforms
            the ground floor into an expansive sequence that mirrors the process
            of preparing a meal: harvesting, storing, preparing, cooking, and
            eating. Each phase reinforces the cyclical nature of food.
          </p>

          <p>
            Housing units are organized around a central courtyard to encourage
            spontaneous interaction. A network of shared outdoor spaces—ranging
            from larger communal courtyards to smaller, semi-private
            thresholds—brings openness and breathing room into a dense
            environment. These layered thresholds blur the line between public and
            private, allowing residents to engage at varying levels of intimacy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Above, four distinct towers emerge, each shaped by roofscapes
            featuring food gardens, greenhouses, solar panels, and outdoor
            kitchens—spaces that extend communal life vertically. Housing types
            range from studios to two-bedroom units, accommodating families,
            culinary students, and chefs. Units are connected by micro-courtyards
            and shared terraces that promote everyday interaction and visual
            connection.

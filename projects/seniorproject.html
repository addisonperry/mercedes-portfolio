          This project, located near Leimert Park along Crenshaw Blvd, extends the
          intimate act of gathering into the urban fabric by combining affordable
          housing with a communal kitchen. The family kitchen becomes a shared
          community space—a nucleus for exchange that transcends place, generations,
          and cultures. Just as my family kitchen fostered togetherness, this project
          explores cooking and creation as a social and collaborative ritual.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          By diagramming the kitchen at an urban scale, the project transforms the
          ground floor into an expansive sequence that mirrors the process of preparing
          a meal: harvesting, storing, preparing, cooking, and eating. Each phase
          reinforces the cyclical nature of food.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Housing units are organized around a central courtyard to encourage
          spontaneous interaction. A network of shared outdoor spaces—ranging from
          larger communal courtyards to smaller, semi-private thresholds—brings
          openness and breathing room into a dense environment. These layered
          thresholds blur the line between public and private, allowing residents to
          engage at varying levels of intimacy.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Above, four distinct towers emerge, each shaped by roofscapes featuring food
          gardens, greenhouses, solar panels, and outdoor kitchens—spaces that extend
          communal life vertically. Housing types range from studios to two-bedroom
          units, accommodating families, culinary students, and chefs. Units are
          connected by micro-courtyards and shared terraces that promote everyday
          interaction and visual connection.

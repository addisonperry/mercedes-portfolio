            The Seaside Orthopedic Center in Seaside, Oregon, is a cutting-edge 
            medical facility designed by a team of four, combining sustainability, 
            safety, and innovative healthcare solutions. The design addresses 
            environmental challenges with a taller southern section that shields 
            a central courtyard from strong winds, creating a comfortable outdoor 
            space for patients and staff to enjoy.
          </p>

          <p>
            A unique ramp gently slopes toward a tsunami evacuation platform that 
            doubles as a garden, emphasizing community safety and ecological 
            integration. This dual-purpose feature reflects the team’s commitment 
            to resilience and sustainability in the face of natural challenges. 
            Constructed with cross-laminated timber (CLT), the center’s wood louver 
            façade seamlessly blends functionality with Oregon’s natural beauty. 
            The U-shaped building layout ensures efficient circulation, while 
            a triple-height atrium, featuring a striking spiral staircase, fosters 
            openness and connectivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            This group project embodies a thoughtful approach to healthcare design, 
            balancing practicality with aesthetics. The collaborative effort highlights 
            the importance of creating healing environments that promote comfort, safety, 
            and community engagement. Through innovative safety features, sustainable 
            materials, and an emphasis on well-being, the Seaside Orthopedic Center 
            stands as a testament to forward-thinking design and teamwork.
